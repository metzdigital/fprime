## Command Line Options:

Command line options are used to change how the F prime CMake setup builds an F prime deployment. These options
typically have sensible defaults that configure the build in the most common way.  Most users do not need to use these
options directly, but may choose to do so.

Note: some deployments may specify their own `-D` cmake flags and these deployments should take care to ensure there
is no collision with the arguments described here.

Users need not specified any of the options to build F prime, however; when non-standard build behavior is desired,
then these options can be used. These options are specified with the -D<OPTION>=<VALUE> flag. Usually the value is
"ON" or "OFF". Other values are documented along side the option.

Note: `fprime-util` will specify some settings for users. Additional settings can be passed through fprime-util with
the `-D` option there.



## `FPRIME_USE_STUBBED_DRIVERS:`

Tells fprime to use the specific stubbed set of drivers as opposed to full implementation. This applies to drivers in
the Drv package with the exception of the serial and ipv4 drivers where a generic cross-platform solution is expected.

If unspecified, it will be set in the platform file for the given architecture. If specified, may be set to ON to use
the stubbed drivers or OFF to use full driver implementations.

if (DEFINED FPRIME_USE_STUBBED_DRIVERS AND NOT "${FPRIME_USE_STUBBED_DRIVERS}" STREQUAL "ON" AND NOT "${FPRIME_USE_STUBBED_DRIVERS}" STREQUAL "OFF")
    message(FATAL_ERROR "FPRIME_USE_STUBBED_DRIVERS must be set to ON, OFF, or not supplied at all")
endif()



## `CMAKE_DEBUG_OUTPUT:`

Turns on the reporting of debug output of the CMake build. Can help refine the CMake system, and repair errors. For
normal usage, this is not necessary.

**Values:**
- ON: generate debugging output
- OFF: (default) do *not* generate debugging output

e.g. `-DCMAKE_DEBUG_OUTPUT=ON`


## `FPRIME_ENABLE_FRAMEWORK_UTS:`

Allow a project to run fprime UTs from the core framework. Default: off, do not run fprime framework UTs. This
does not affect project specified UTs.

**Values:**
- ON: (default) adds framework UT targets to the total list of targets
- OFF: do not add framework UTs to the target list

e.g. `-DFPRIME_ENABLE_FRAMEWORK_UTS=OFF`


## `FPRIME_ENABLE_AUTOCODER_UTS:`

When FPRIME_ENABLE_FRAMEWORK_UTS is set, this allows a projects to also enable running the autocoder UTs which do not
represent the correctness of the C++/product software, but rather the operation of the autocoder tools.

**Values:**
- ON: (default) retains the autocoder UTs in the target list
- OFF: removes autocoder UTs from the target list

e.g. `-DFPRIME_ENABLE_AUTOCODER_UTS=OFF`


## `SKIP_TOOLS_CHECK:`

For older clients, some IDEs, and other unique builds, the check that ensures tools are available can fail causing
build instability. This option overrides the tools check enabling the system to run.

**Values:**
- ON: skip tools check
- OFF: (default) run tools check

e.g. `-DSKIP_TOOLS_CHECK=ON`


## `FPRIME_ENABLE_TEXT_LOGGERS:`

When FPRIME_ENABLE_TEXT_LOGGERS is set, the ActiveTextLogger and PassiveConsoleTextLogger
svc components are included in the build. When unset, those components are excluded,
allowing FpConfig.hpp:FW_ENABLE_TEXT_LOGGING to be unset as well, to save space.
TextLoggers will fail to build if FW_ENABLE_TEXT_LOGGING=0.

**Values:**
- ON: (default) retains the text logger components in the target list
- OFF: removes text logger components from the target list

e.g. `-DFPRIME_ENABLE_TEXT_LOGGERS=OFF`


## `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:`

Allows for setting the CMake build type. Release is a normal build, Testing is used for unit testing and debug
options.

**Values:**
- Release: (default) standard flight build
- Testing: allow for unit tests and debug enabled build
- Debug: supplied by CMake and typically unused for F prime

e.g. `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=TESTING`


## `CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:`

CMake option to specify toolchain file. For F prime, toolchains are kept in the framework and library cmake/toolchain
folder, although theoretically any CMake toolchain can be used. Default: none, which will use the native system build.

e.g. `-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=/path/to/cmake/toolchain`


## Locations `FPRIME_FRAMEWORK_PATH`, `FPRIME_PROJECT_ROOT`, `FPRIME_LIBRARY_LOCATIONS`
`FPRIME_AC_CONSTANTS_FILE`, and `FPRIME_CONFIG_DIR`:

Note: these settings are supplied by `fprime-util` and need not be provided unless running CMake directly or through
any way bypassing that utility (e.g. inside your beloved IDE).

These locations specify the locations of the needed F prime paths. These are described below. Defaults are set to
support the historical in-source deployments where F prime is merged with deployment code. Specify these settings if
using the newer deployment structure. `fprime-util` does this for you.

FPRIME_FRAMEWORK_PATH: location of F prime framework installation, always the directory above this file, however;
since it is supplied by the project, it is validated to ensure that it points to a valid F prime framework install.
Default: the folder above this file.

e.g. `-DFPRIME_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/path/to/fprime/framework`

FPRIME_PROJECT_ROOT: root path of an F prime project. This is used for relative paths for c++ includes, component
includes, etc. Default is FPRIME_FRAMEWORK_PATH if the PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR is a child of FPRIME_FRAMEWORK_PATH
otherwise PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR is used as the project root.

e.g. `-DFPRIME_FRAMEWORK_PATH=/path/to/fprime/project`

FPRIME_LIBRARY_LOCATIONS: locations of libraries included in the build. CMake list supplied in ; separated format like
other CMake lists. Default: "", no libraries available.

e.g. `-DFPRIME_LIBRARY_LOCATIONS=/path/to/fprime/library1;/path/to/fprime/library2`

Additional locations FPRIME_SETTINGS_FILE and FPRIME_ENVIRONMENT_FILE:

These files are used for settings in fprime-util. If supplied (typically only by fprime-util) then
they will be added as dependencies into the build system.
